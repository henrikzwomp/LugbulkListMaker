# LugbulkListMaker
Tool for creating lists to aid the dividing of LUGBULK orders.

## About 
If you don't know what LUGBULK is then this tool is not for you. Its purpose is to create lists that can be used when dividing up bricks shipped by TLG in the LUGBULK program. 

The tool is a work of progress and currently not user-friendly at all. It is recommended that that you have knowledge of the code behind this tool when using it.
