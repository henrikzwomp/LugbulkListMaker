# LugbulkListMaker
Tool for creating lists to aid the dividing of LUGBULK orders.


## About 
If you don't know what LUGBULK is then this tool is not for you. Its purpose is to create lists that can be used when dividing up the bricks shipped by TLG in the LUGBULK program. 

The tool is a work of progress and not user-friendly at all. Access to and knowledge of the code is recommended for anyone that would like to use this tool in its current state. 

The reason the tool is on GitHub is so that it will be available for the LUG I belong to if I for some reason can't be reached.
