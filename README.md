# LugbulkListMaker
Tool for creating lists to aid the dividing of LUGBULK orders.


## About 
If you don't know what LUGBULK is then this tool is not for you. Its purpose is to create lists that can be used when dividing up the bricks shipped by TLG in the LUGBULK program. 

This code is quite messy and not really something one would like to make public. I have uploaded it on GitHub so it is available for the LUG I belong to if I for some reason is unavailable.
